# Hive's main features:
## 1. It supports standard SQL.
## 2. It was born to support batch process, it uses MapReduce framework to execute missions.
## 3. It has High Delay Performance becuase it has no index, moreover, MapReduce has high delay feature. So it's not used to do real time query jobs. It is good for batch processing jobs though, for example: network log analysis.
